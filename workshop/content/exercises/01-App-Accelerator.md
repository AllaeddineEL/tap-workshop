[[[ Narrative Context: Pet Clinic App ]]]

We begin with a developer joining the Pet Clinic project. When a new developer joins an existing project, generally they want to begin by achieving three things:
1. Download and install all the necessary components to edit, build, and run the project
2. Successfully build and package the current code base
3. Successfully deploy and run the application in the appropriate environment
