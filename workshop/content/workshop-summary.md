Want to have more time to take your learning further?  Download and install [Tanzu Community Edition](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu/community) on your development machine in Docker, on virtual machines in a public cloud, or in a private VMware vSphere environment! 

Tanzu Community Edition is the free, community-supported, open-source distribution of VMware Tanzu.  It includes Tanzu Kubernetes Grid and the Tanzu Application Toolkit.  The Tanzu Application Toolkit contains the components needed to orchestrate workload deployments using [Cartographer](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/cartographer).  You get container image build services provided by [kpack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/kpack/.  And the toolkit includes services to run your workloads using [Knative Serving](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/).

You can also download and install the open-source [RabbitMQ Operator for Kubernetes](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html).

The current (0.11) release of Tanzu Community Edition doesn't include the Service Bindings system package.  Still, you can install it separately by following the install instructions on the [latest release page for the Service Bindings project](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/servicebinding/releases).  The Service Bindings package is planned for inclusion in future releases of Tanzu Community Edition, so check the project release notes for updates!
