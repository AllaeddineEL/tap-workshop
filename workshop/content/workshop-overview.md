# TAP High Level Demonstration

**Tanzu Application Platform (TAP)** builds a **world class developer and application operator experience** onto Kubernetes by creating a layer of abstraction onto the individual components in the DevSecOps toolchain that is leveraged in building, testing, verifying, deploying, and operating applications. This new experience is accomplished through the addition of enhanced developer tooling, supply chain automation, and coordination of work/separation of concerns between developers, architects, security teams, and operators both as part of Tanzu Advanced and installed independently on any API-compatible Kubernetes distribution.

This demonstration is intended to walk the audience through both the simplicity and the power of the core TAP components. The first part of the demonstration is a simple walkthrough of getting a new developer onboarded in an existing software project. Later parts will dive deeper into the developer and operator experiences and functionality, respectively.
